# And Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Ryan, a junior programmer at DigiPen Institute of Technology where I'm studying real time interactive simulation! Past titles I've worked on while here are Chromatic Split and Isles of Limbo, along with a new game under development right now (sneak peaks can be found here)!
My experiences and interests revolve around the following topics: 

> Game Mechanics
> 
> Graphics
>
> Engine Development

I'm currently in the market for a great internship in one of these fields where I'll be able to learn and help produce some great results! Above you can find links for my contact information, resume, info about DigiPen games I've worked on, and personal programming projects. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to chat about any of my projects are or opportunities.

I hope you enjoy your visit!
