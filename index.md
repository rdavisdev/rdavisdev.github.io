# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Ryan, a junior programmer at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. I'm studying real time interactive simulation and loving every bit of it. Past titles I've worked on while here are [Chromatic Split]() and [Isles of Limbo](), along with a new game under development [right now](). 

My experiences and interests are in the following topics: 

> Game Mechanics
> 
> Graphics
>
> Engine Development

I'm currently searching for an internship in one of these fields. Hopefully one where I'll be able to learn and help produce some great results! Above you can find links for my [resume](), info about [games]() I've worked on, and personal programming [projects](). Feel free to [contact]() me if you'd like to chat about my projects or opportunities.

I hope you enjoy your visit!
