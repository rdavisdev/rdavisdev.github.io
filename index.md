<h1 id="games" style="text-align: center;">Hello and Welcome!</h1>

<hr>

My name is Ryan, a junior programmer at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. I'm studying real-time interactive simulation and loving every bit of it. Past titles I've worked on while here are [Chromatic Split](https://rdavisdev.github.io/games) and [Isles of Limbo](https://rdavisdev.github.io/games). My team and I are currently working on an under development game called [Behemyth](https://rdavisdev.github.io/games). 

My experiences and interests are in the following topics: 

- Graphics
- Gameplay Programming
- Engine Development

I'm searching for an internship in one of these fields. Hopefully one where I'll be able to learn and help produce some great results! Above you can find links for my [resume](https://rdavisdev.github.io/info), info about [games](https://rdavisdev.github.io/games) I've worked on, and personal programming [projects](https://rdavisdev.github.io/projects). Feel free to [contact](https://rdavisdev.github.io/info) me if you'd like to chat about any of my projects or future opportunities.

I hope you enjoy your visit!
