# Isles of Limbo (C++/C#)

2019-2020 semester project at DigiPen, Isles of Limbo is an action packed hack and slash featuring creative enemy designs, scenic ambience, and a wide move set to dispatch foes with. Using our team's custom built engine, we sought to produce a game with eye catching visuals and fast paced gameplay. Resulting in hundreds of followers on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1389260/Isles_of_Limbo/) and dozens of [youtube playthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=isles+of+limbo), the attention this student project got was a gratifying experience.
Areas of responsibility:

> Graphics: With Argonautic's amazing art team, I was lucky to be the engine's graphics programmer. Using OpenGL, I implimented core functionality like sprite rendering and Spine animations. I also developed tools such as the determinate particle system, deferred glow shaders, and the stencil culling system. I also handled the mid-project switch from 2D to psuedo-3D in a seamless method. Video file streaming was another graphical feature of the engine.

> Engine Developement: I worked closely with the early development of the engine's foundation. Functionality I worked on includes instanced entities, serialization of scenes and assets, entity and component referencing, entity parenting hierarchies, and modular viewports. Later in the project's lifecycle, I added the performance diagnostics toolset and a per-entity timewarp system.
